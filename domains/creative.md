# Creative Projects

## Current State
Active creative pursuits and their current status. Rotating through interests during evening hobby blocks.
The list looks good. Need to include languages: imagine a creative project in another language!

## Active Goals

- Current project or piece in progress per discipline
- Skills development targets (technique, tools, materials)
- Completed works to exhibit or share

## Habits & Routines

- **Evening block:** 2-hour weekday sessions, cycling through:
  - Drawing
  - Painting
  - Sculpture
  - Reading
  - Programming (personal)
  - Electronics
  - Modelling
- **Flow states:** Dedicated uninterrupted periods scheduled via [calendar](calendar.md)
