# Calendar & Scheduling

## Current State
Google Calendar MCP is configured for automated reads via `/gaia-plan`. Calendar events are pulled into morning planning and reflected in `temporal/today.md`.
the calendar MCP needs to be configured yet.

## Active Goals

- Protect focus blocks from fragmentation
- Balance work, personal, and creative time

## Habits & Routines

**Daily rhythm:**

- **Morning:** Alarm, water & tablets, 5-min meditation, 10-min stretching, 15-min cardio, 20-min coffee & breakfast with AI planning session
- **Work blocks:** Focused pomodoro sessions with auto-responses during deep work
- **Gym:** Post-work session (rotation per [health](health.md))
- **Evening:** Dinner prep, 2-hour hobby/project rotation, wind-down

**Weekly patterns:**

- Recurring meetings and project syncs
- Weekly review session (Sunday, via `/gaia-review weekly`)
