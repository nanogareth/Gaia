# Business Ideas

## Current State
Pipeline of business concepts at various stages — from raw ideas to validated concepts to active pursuits.
- Lucentic

## Active Goals

- Capture and label ideas quickly (avoid distraction during focus time)
- Evaluate ideas on a regular cycle (not in the moment)
- Move promising ideas to validation stage with concrete next steps

## Habits & Routines

- **Capture:** Quick ideation via `/gaia-inbox` — tag and defer for later review
- **Weekly review:** Assess idea pipeline, prioritize for deeper exploration
- **Dedicated sessions:** Scheduled ideation/validation blocks (see [calendar](calendar.md))

## Notes

### Idea Pipeline

**Raw Ideas** (captured, not yet evaluated)

- _Use `/gaia-inbox` to add ideas here_

**Under Evaluation** (being researched/validated)

- _Move promising ideas here during weekly review_

**Parked** (interesting but not now)

- _Ideas deferred to a future quarter_
