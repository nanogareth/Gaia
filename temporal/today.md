# Today's Plan — 2026-02-19 (Thursday)

## Schedule

- **Morning:** Water & tablets, 5-min meditation, 10-min stretching, 15-min cardio, coffee & breakfast with planning
- **Work blocks:** Focused pomodoro sessions — see Priorities below
- **Gym:** Post-work session (today's rotation: check which day in the Legs+Shoulders / Biceps+Chest+Core / Triceps+Back+Core cycle)
- **Evening:** Dinner prep, 2-hour hobby/project rotation, wind-down

Calendar: unavailable (Google Calendar MCP not connected this session)

## Priorities

1. **[goals]** Define Q1 2026 targets — all domain goals are currently placeholders. Pick 2-3 domains and set concrete, measurable targets via `/gaia-update goals` and the respective domain files
2. **[ai-projects]** Define next milestone for at least one AI project (MiniLang, SET, or 3D-Viz-MCP) — update via `/gaia-update ai-projects`
3. **[work-projects]** Define next milestone for FlowForge and Edify — last activity was Feb 16 (Express v5 fix for FlowForge)
4. **[health]** Fill in Current State with actual fitness narrative — the scaffolding is in place but needs real data
5. **[finances]** Weekly transaction review (per routine — it's Thursday, good day to catch up before the weekend)

## Carry-Forward

- From 2026-02-15: FlowForge Express v5 fix was completed. No incomplete items flagged.

## Domain Snapshots

| Domain | Status | Last Updated | Key Note |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| ai-projects | active | Feb 16 | 3 projects, all need milestone definitions |
| work-projects | active | Feb 16 | FlowForge + Edify, milestones undefined |
| health | active | Feb 16 | Scaffolded, needs real Current State |
| finances | active | Feb 16 | Scaffolded, weekly review due |
| languages | active | Feb 16 | Scaffolded, needs language specifics |
| social | active | Feb 16 | Scaffolded, needs contact details |
| creative | active | Feb 16 | Scaffolded, 7-discipline rotation defined |
| calendar | active | Feb 16 | MCP configured, daily rhythm documented |
| goals | active | Feb 16 | Q1 structure in place, all targets are placeholders |
| business-ideas | active | Feb 16 | Pipeline structure ready, no ideas captured yet |

## Notes

- All domain files were seeded with structural scaffolding on Feb 16 (Phase 4). The system is now functional but domains need real content to be useful. Focus on high-value domains first (goals, projects, health).
- Next review cycle for all domains: 2026-02-22 (Sunday). Use `/gaia-review weekly` then.
- Consider running `/gaia-update` on 2-3 domains today to populate real data.
